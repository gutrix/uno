# Uno

This project is a WIP. It is currently in early development.

Made by William Wayland, william.wayland@griffithuni.edu.au.

# Get Uno Running 

Get our Uno Card Game running with this simple three part program!

1. Download [rustup](https://rustup.rs) and set up Rust Nightly 1.27.0 *
2. Run `cargo run --release`
3. Profit?

Now this program can be all yours for only ten easy payments of $open_source. What a steal!

*May not work for newer or older versions of Rust. Who knows what the future may hold. 

# Versions and Roadmap

The project is currently in version *0.1.1* . The project will make incremental changes until it reaches Version *1.0* .

Version *1.x* will be released when all of the long term goals have been met (i.e. LAN Multiplayer, GUI, see the [Projects](https://github.com/gutrix/uno/projects/1) tab. Changes to *x* will most likely be bug fixes. I don't plan on working on this after 1.0 unless I need to fix something.
